# houseMates

## description
Throughout my life, I have been a bad roommate... Sometimes I would forget to put cups back to the sink because I was practicing for a violin competition.  Sometimes I was so engaged in studying that I didn't notice a new life growing in our kitchen, what caused many unpleasant conversations with my roommates.

### all of that could have easily been avoided
if someone have introduced me to the houseMates...

## ideology
In the real household there are no boundries and authorization between the housemates! You trust each other, you contribute to the common chores, and you spend each others' money... That's why in houseMates any one can post and remove items from the taskList and shoppingList. The message system was designed to imitate the "stickies" you post on your fridge. In real life, anyone can remove them! That's why you can remove notes posted by another household members if you find them annoying or sad! 
> "Because in houseMates we trust each other"
