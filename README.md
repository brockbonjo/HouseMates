# houseMates

## description
Throughout my life, I have been a bad roommate... Sometimes I would forget to put cups back to the sink because I was practicing for a violin competition.  Sometimes I was so engaged in studying that I didn't notice a new life growing in our kitchen, which caused many unpleasant conversations with my roommates.

### all of that could have easily been avoided
if someone have introduced me to the houseMates...
